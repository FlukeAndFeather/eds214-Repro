# Exceeded spec

## The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review

I have given my peer constructive feedback on their reproducible project. With details as to what they have done well and what they should change for example move a script to a appropriate file. 

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

I have added a simple flowchart in my README and a section with instruction on how to reproduce my work with package names and files that will be found in the project. The files are linked to their GitHub page for optional review.  


# Collaborate

My peer participation feedback went well. I tried to be specific on my directions and used visuals and examples to explain the fix.
