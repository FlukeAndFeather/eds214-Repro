Sample collection and analysis
Weekly water sampling began on QS and QT in 1983 (McDowell & Asbury
1994), BQ1, BQ2 and BQ3 in 1988, and PRM, QPA and QPB in 1989, thus
this study includes a period prior to Hurricane Hugo and 5 y after (Table 2).
Streamwater sampling at QT was discontinued in November 1987 and reinitiated immediately after the September 1989 hurricane.
