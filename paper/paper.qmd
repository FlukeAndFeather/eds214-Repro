## Background


## Data

To recreate figure 3 from Shaefer et al. (2000) paper I download the following `.csv` from the ***Environmental Data Initiative*** found in the following: [(McDowell and INternational Institute Of Tropical Forest (IITF) 2024)] (https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.4923064)



## Methods
```{r}
source("R/moving_average_FUN.R")
```


## Results

```{r}
water_plot <- ggplot(data = stream_anly, aes(x = sample_date, 
                            y = conc_aver)) +

  labs(y = "Average Concentration of Nutrient",
       title = "Concentration in Bisley, Puerto Rico streams before and after Hurrican Hugo",
       x = "Year",
       color = "Basins")+
  geom_line(aes(color = basins)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-18"),
             linetype = "dotdash") +
  facet_wrap(ions~ .,
             ncol = 1,
             scales = "free_y")+
  theme_bw()
water_plot
ggsave("figs/water_plot.png")
