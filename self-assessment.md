# Automate

## Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

Not yet;
I still need to finish editing my Quarto document. I am currently filling in my methods section. Once I add results I can try to render and check that it runs before returning to make further detail edits.


## The analysis runs without errors

Meet spec;
my analysis has run without errors.

## The analysis produces the expected output

Meet spec; 
My analysis has given me the expected output I want which is my moving average. 

## Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)

Meet spec;
I have work on my data import and cleaning in an R script stored in my scratch folder. 

# Organize

## Raw data is contained in its own folder

Meet spec;
The raw data was saved in my data folder

## Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

Not yet;
I have not saved my intermediate outputs. I will need to create a .csv with my cleaned data and create a Rds.

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

Meet spec;
I have refactored a moving average function it own file named R 

# Document

## The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

Not yet;
I have created a README and added headers and some background information. I still need to add analysis script, support code, and outputs

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

Not yet;
I need to create a flowchart explaing how the analysis works 

## The code is appropriately commented

Not yet;
Have made comments but would like to review. 

## Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention

Not yet;
I have started but would like to change more of them. 

# Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

## Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

Not yet;
I need to create this script. I would use an R script to list all library used in this analysis

## The analysis script runs without errors

Not yet;
I have to complete my analysis script to do this step.
